Subterrane is an exploration-horror game set in an underground cave system.  You play a caver who fell deep into the caves while exploring and are now searching for a way out, running, jumping, climbing, and crawling while dealing with the creatures that live inside.  

We used the Unity3D game engine as a 10 week class project. The original concept was a caving (spelunking) game, which developed into a sort of horror-platformer, playing on the fear of depths, tight spaces, darkness, and centipedes.
